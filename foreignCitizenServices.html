<h2>Immigration Office</h2>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/immigration_office.jpg" alt="Pohang Immigration Office">
  Pohang's immigration office is called <em>Daegu Immigration Office Pohang Branch</em>.  It's located a few blocks back from Yeongildae Beach in Duho-dong.
  It's important for foreigner to go here when they first arrive in Korea to get their Alien Registration Card (ARC).  They should be sure to come back every 
  year before their ARC expires.  In order to successfully register as an alien or renew their registration, several documents will be necessary.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>ARC card (if you are renewing)</li>
  <li>30,000 won to pay for the ARC card (if you don't have one yet)</li>
  <li>2 passport size photos (if you don't have an ARC card yet)</li>
  <li>application for alien registration</li>
  <li>60,000 won to pay for application fee</li>
  <li>schedule of classes (for teachers)</li>
  <li>business registration form(from place of employment) </li>
  <li>work contract (for those on employment visas)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Hospitals</h2>
<p>
  Pohang Euilyowon Hospital in Yongheung-dong is probably the cheapest place to get your mandatory health check-up.  It costs 75,000 won compared
  to over 100,000 won for many other hospitals.  Also, it isn't one of the busiest hospitals in Pohang and therefore wait times can be quite short.  Other 
  major hospitals include Pohang St. Mary's Hospital in I-dong and Good Sunlin Hospital which is just north of the downtown area.  These are the largest
  hospitals in Pohang and would be the place to go for more complicated procedures.  They are probably not the best place for your mandatory health check-up.
  Pohang Euilyowon can get this simple procedure done more quickly than the major hospitals.  The entire process for getting the health check-up can take 
  around an hour or slightly more.  The health check-up will include the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>vision test</li>
  <li>hearing test</li>
  <li>measurement of weight, height, and chest</li>
  <li>dental check-up</li>
  <li>blood test</li>
  <li>urine test</li>
  <li>chest x-ray</li>
</ol>
<p>
  When you go to the hospital for the health check-up you should remember to bring these things with you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>75,000 won fee</li>
  <li>ARC card</li>
  <li>2 passport size photos</li>
  <li>a korean translation for "health check-up for foreign teachers" which is "waegukin seonsaengnim geongang geomjin"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dental Clinics</h2>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/dental_clinic.jpeg" alt="Shinsaegye Dental Clinic">
  If you're looking for a dental clinic in Pohang, an excellent choice would be Shinsaegye Dental Clinic in Duho-dong.  It's located one block back from
  Yeongildae Beach.  Staff are capable of conversing in a basic level of English if you're not very strong in Korean.  Their facilities is state of the
  art and the staff is very knowledgeable in the latest dental practices.  They aren't the newest or largest of dental clinics in Pohang and this may be 
  cause of their relatively short wait times.  Their business hours are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mon, Wed, Thurs, Fri: 9:20 AM - 6:30 PM</li>
  <li>Tue: 9:20 AM - 8:00 PM</li>
  <li>Sat: 9:30 AM - 2:00 PM</li>
  <li>Sun: closed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Driver's License Testing Center</h2>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/dmv.jpg" alt="Pohang Driver's License Testing Center">
  The Pohang Driver's License Testing Center is located outside of Pohang in the town of Ocheon.  There are two methods for obtaining a valid driver's license
  in Korea.  The first is to exchange your driver's license from your home country for a Korean one.  For the most part, you will easily be able to exchange 
  your home license. It is the fastest and easiest way to be a legal driver in Korea. Exchanging your license is in some ways still a temporary license and is 
  a literal exchange of licensing cards. The exchange requires that you give the local office the physical copy of your home license. Then when you leave Korea
  your home license will be returned to you when you give the local office your Korean license. You may want to consider becoming a certified Korean driver if 
  you are living in Korea permanently or for a long-extended period.  The certified Korean license is valid for 10 years.  You will receive a level 2 regular 
  Korean license (standard automatic vehicles) if you exchange your license.  You can choose between level 1 (standard manual vehicles) or level 2 if you 
  complete the full licensing process.  You have up to one year to renew your license when it expires.  You need over 40 driving penalty points to have your 
  license suspended.  You can be penalized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>speeding = 30 points</li>
  <li>drunk driving = 100 points</li>
  <li>signal violations = 15 points</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When you visit the Driver's License Testing Center don't forget to bring the following items with you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>valid foreign driver's license (if exchanging)</li>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>ARC card</li>
  <li>3 color passport photos (3cm x 4cm)
  <li>a letter from your country's consulate confirming the validity of your home license (if exchanging)</li>
  <li>16,000 won fee</li>
</ul>

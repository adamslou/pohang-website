  Six on the Beach is an Ultimate (also known as Ultimate Frisbee) tournament that takes place during the last weekend of August every summer at Yeongildae 
  Beach in Pohang.  The 2019 tournament will take place August 24th-25th from 11:00 AM - 8:00 PM on Saturday and 10:00 AM - 4:30 PM on Sunday.  There will be
  around 12 players on each team with 6 players from each team on the field at the same time.  It's a hat tournament which means that names will be drawn from
  a hat randomly to form teams.  Experience playing Ultimate is not required but most players have at least a basic level of throwing and catching discs.  
  Registration is done on a first-come first-serve basis.  More information and the registration form can be found on the
